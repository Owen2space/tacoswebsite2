            <h2>Who We Are</h2>
            <p>
              We are a team of visionary engineers, developers, and innovators who share one singular mission: to transform the
              future of aerial operations. From infrastructure monitoring to logistics, environmental analysis, and tactical field
              support, our drone technologies are engineered to perform in diverse conditions and deliver dependable results when
              accuracy and efficiency matter most.
            </p>
            <p>
              At TACOS Technologies, our commitment to engineering trust is cemented on a foundation of research, integrity, and
              excellence. We don't just build drones, we build solutions that empower businesses, government agencies, and

            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>
              TACOS Technologies began as a small idea born from curiosity, nurtured by a deep appreciation for the evolving role
              unmanned aerial systems are increasingly playing in modern society. A prototype project turned mission: to make drone
              innovation accessible, intelligent, and impactful across Africa.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our founders recognized a gap&mdash;many industries needed drone solutions that were reliable, cost-effective, and
              locally adaptable. We combined advanced design with strategic partnerships to close that gap.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, TACOS Technologies stands as a homegrown innovator, marrying technical prowess with deep insight into regional
              needs to build drone systems designed for real-world performance, not just lab tests.
